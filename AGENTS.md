# Repository Guidelines

- Repo: https://github.com/PotLock/foxfang
- In chat replies, file references must be repo-root relative only (example: `extensions/bluebubbles/src/channel.ts:80`); never absolute paths or `~/...`.
- Do not edit files covered by security-focused `CODEOWNERS` rules unless a listed owner explicitly asked for the change or is already reviewing it with you. Treat those paths as restricted surfaces, not drive-by cleanup.

## FoxFang Product Vision & Positioning

FoxFang is a **specialized autonomous agent system for supporting digital marketing operations**. It helps individuals, creators, small businesses, and lean teams handle repeated marketing work such as brief analysis, content planning, draft creation, channel adaptation, recurring reports, and team coordination.

Keep the positioning accurate to the current source and thesis scope:

- FoxFang is built on a general agent platform and adapted for the marketing use case.
- FoxFang supports marketing work at a foundational/assistive level; do not describe it as a complete marketing suite or a fully autonomous campaign manager.
- FoxFang creates drafts, suggestions, summaries, schedules, and reports; sensitive outbound actions remain under human control.
- FoxFang is not a one-shot copywriting chatbot, not fixed workflow automation, and not a replacement for a marketing department.
- FoxFang's current marketing implementation is mainly a generic agent runtime plus marketing tools, marketing store objects, draft/approval workflow, scheduling support, memory, channels, and tool policy.

### Core marketing operations loop

Use this loop as the product direction and documentation frame:

```text
Brief -> Strategy -> Plan -> Create -> Approve -> Publish -> Measure -> Learn -> Optimize
```

Every feature or subsystem should align with one or more stages of this loop. Be precise about what is implemented now versus planned.

- **Brief** - Receives marketing briefs, product context, audience, constraints, expected KPIs, and missing information.
- **Strategy** - Helps reason about brand, product, audience, positioning, channels, and message direction.
- **Plan** - Builds campaign outlines, content plans, schedules, and task lists.
- **Create** - Generates draft posts, captions, scripts, ad copy, FAQs, creative notes, and follow-up messages.
- **Approve** - Keeps humans in control before publishing, sending bulk messages, modifying ads, or changing budgets.
- **Publish** - Supports scheduling or outbound delivery only through configured integrations and approval gates.
- **Measure** - Summarizes provided/read-only metrics and reports when data is available.
- **Learn** - Stores reusable decisions, notes, and insights in memory/workspace state.
- **Optimize** - Suggests improvements for later campaigns based on available context and results.

### Capability layers

Use these layers as a design direction, not as proof that every layer is fully implemented:

```text
Brand Intelligence
-> Product Intelligence
-> Audience & Strategy
-> Campaign Planning
-> Content Factory
-> Channel Adaptation
-> Approval & Publishing
-> Ads & Analytics
-> CRM & Lead Follow-up
-> Learning & Optimization
```

When adding new modules, place them in the correct layer and do not bypass lower-context layers. For example, do not add content generation that ignores brand/product context when that context is available.

### Current implementation scope

Be careful not to overclaim. The current source supports these thesis-safe system facts:

- agent command boundary for trusted local/CLI entry and gateway/network ingress;
- gateway runtime for HTTP/WebSocket requests, channel lifecycle, cron, run state, and dispatch;
- session resolution and JSONL transcripts;
- workspace Markdown memory plus memory search/indexing through the memory plugin;
- plugin and tool registration with tool-policy filtering;
- model provider selection, fallback, and embedded/CLI/ACP execution paths;
- cron scheduling for recurring tasks;
- multi-channel routing and delivery through configured channel integrations;
- marketing store objects such as brands, products, campaigns, content plans, post drafts, approvals, insights, and leads;
- marketing tools for draft creation, channel adaptation, approval request/resolution, scheduling, and guarded outbound behavior.

Marketing actions such as strategy, planning, reports, and ad analysis should be described as **supported by the agent and available data/tools**, not as proof of a complete dedicated ads platform or enterprise campaign-management product.

### Multi-agent model

FoxFang can use multiple isolated agents, subagent/tool delegation, workspaces, identities, and routing bindings. For marketing documentation, a coordinator + specialist model is a useful product direction:

| Role                       | Intended responsibility                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Marketing Orchestrator** | Receives briefs, decomposes work, coordinates state, and chooses the next step.             |
| **Strategy Lead**          | Helps analyze brand, product, audience, competitors, positioning, and messaging.            |
| **Content Specialist**     | Creates drafts, adapts content per channel, and follows brand voice.                        |
| **Growth Analyst**         | Reviews available metrics, highlights issues, produces reports, and proposes optimizations. |

Do **not** claim these roles are separate concrete runtime classes unless the source implements that separation. In the current codebase, CLI `agents` are isolated runtime/workspace/routing units; marketing specialist roles can be modeled through prompts, workspaces, identities, skills, tools, or future modules.

### Core data objects

FoxFang should model marketing state explicitly rather than flattening everything into chat text. The key objects are:

| Object        | Purpose                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Brand         | Brand voice, values, positioning, audience, and guardrails.               |
| Product       | Product catalog, features, benefits, USPs, pricing, objections, and FAQs. |
| Audience      | Target segments, behaviors, pain points, and constraints.                 |
| Campaign      | Structured campaign brief, timeline, channels, KPIs, and status.          |
| ContentPlan   | Editorial calendar or content pipeline.                                   |
| PostDraft     | Platform-specific draft with lifecycle status.                            |
| CreativeBrief | Image/video asset requirements and shot list.                             |
| Channel       | Platform configuration and adaptation rules.                              |
| Lead          | Potential customer/contact information and follow-up history.             |
| Task          | Marketing task queue with deadlines or recurrence.                        |
| Report        | Campaign or performance report.                                           |
| Insight       | Reusable learning extracted from previous work.                           |
| Approval      | Approval state for sensitive outbound actions.                            |

Some of these objects are already represented in the marketing store; others are expansion surfaces. When designing schemas or APIs, keep the objects explicit and stateful.

### Approval & safety principle

```text
read-first, draft-first, approval-before-write
```

FoxFang must not publish content, send bulk messages, mutate ads, or change ad spend without explicit human approval. This is a hard product requirement, not a preference. Any code path that performs an outbound write or budget mutation must go through an approval gate and tool policy.

Actions requiring approval: publish social posts, send bulk messages, publish/modify ads, change ad budget, enable/disable campaigns, change targeting, or perform other sensitive external writes.

Actions not requiring approval by default: generate ideas, create drafts, build calendars, generate reports, read configured analytics, summarize provided data, and create internal reminders.

### Development priority

Prefer completing the current foundational scope before expanding:

- **Implemented/foundational:** agent runtime, gateway, sessions, memory, cron, channel routing, plugin/tool registry, marketing store, draft/adaptation/approval/scheduling tools, and outbound guards.
- **Near-term expansion:** stronger campaign lifecycle, content calendar state, approval history, asset checklist, social draft review surfaces, weekly reports, and campaign memory.
- **Future expansion:** read-only ads integrations, ads recommendations, A/B testing planner, auto publishing after approval, KPI dashboard, CRM workflow, budget guardrails, brand compliance, and a deeper learning loop.

Do not document a future item as available unless the specific integration, user flow, and tests exist.

### How FoxFang differs from a chatbot

A chatbot usually responds turn by turn. A user asks for a post, receives a post, and the interaction ends. Later turns often lack the campaign, product, approved-content, or prior-insight context.

FoxFang is intended to maintain and reuse brand context, product information, content history, user feedback, and past insights so later requests stay connected. The difference is not only that FoxFang can write content; it can use memory, tools, sessions, scheduling, and approval controls to support marketing as a longer-running process.

### How FoxFang differs from fixed automation

Traditional automation follows fixed rules: when event A happens, do B, then C, then send D. That works for rigid repeatable tasks, but marketing briefs change with product, audience, timing, channel, market feedback, and available data.

FoxFang can use calendars, recurring tasks, and app integrations as supporting tools. The product definition is the agent's ability to understand requests, read context, choose an approach, use allowed tools, respond to users, adapt to new information, and save useful insights.

### Core value

FoxFang's value is not a single generated post. It combines:

```text
Brand context + Product intelligence + Work history + Marketing tools
+ App integrations + Reporting + Insights + Approval controls
```

so small teams can run marketing as a controlled long-running process rather than disconnected question-and-answer turns.

### Positioning language

Use wording like:

- FoxFang is a **specialized autonomous agent system for supporting digital marketing operations**.
- FoxFang helps a very small team prepare and coordinate work that would normally involve planning, writing, social coordination, analytics review, and reporting.
- FoxFang **supports, orchestrates, and assists** marketing operations. Do not say it autonomously executes or optimizes campaigns unless the exact integration is implemented and approval-gated.
- FoxFang helps 1-2 operators handle repeatable marketing work; it does not replace final judgment on brand, spend, legal/compliance, or public communication.
- Marketing work starts from a **marketing brief** or **campaign brief**, not just a generic goal.
- Closing line for docs: FoxFang is a **marketing operations agent** - not a copywriting chatbot, not fixed automation - with context, tools, integrations, memory, and human control of sensitive outbound actions.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- Source code: `src/` (CLI wiring in `src/cli`, commands in `src/commands`, web provider in `src/provider-web.ts`, infra in `src/infra`, media pipeline in `src/media`).
- Tests: colocated `*.test.ts`.
- Docs: `docs/` (images, queue, Pi config). Built output lives in `dist/`.
- Nomenclature: use "plugin" / "plugins" in docs, UI, changelogs, and contributor guidance. `extensions/*` remains the internal directory/package path to avoid repo-wide churn from a rename.
- Bundled plugin naming: for repo-owned workspace plugins, keep the canonical plugin id aligned across `foxfang.plugin.json:id`, `extensions/<id>` by default, and package names anchored to the same id (`@foxfang/<id>` or approved suffix forms like `-provider`, `-plugin`, `-speech`, `-sandbox`, `-media-understanding`). Keep `foxfang.install.npmSpec` equal to the package name and `foxfang.channel.id` equal to the plugin id when present. Exceptions must be explicit and covered by the repo invariant test.
- Plugins: live under `extensions/*` (workspace packages). Keep plugin-only deps in the extension `package.json`; do not add them to the root `package.json` unless core uses them.
- Plugins: install runs `npm install --omit=dev` in plugin dir; runtime deps must live in `dependencies`. Avoid `workspace:*` in `dependencies` (npm install breaks); put `foxfang` in `devDependencies` or `peerDependencies` instead (runtime resolves `foxfang/plugin-sdk` via jiti alias).
- Import boundaries: extension production code should treat `foxfang/plugin-sdk/*` plus local `api.ts` / `runtime-api.ts` barrels as the public surface. Do not import core `src/**`, `src/plugin-sdk-internal/**`, or another extension's `src/**` directly.
- Installers served from `https://foxfang.ai/*`: live in the sibling repo `../foxfang.ai` (`public/install.sh`, `public/install-cli.sh`, `public/install.ps1`).
- Messaging channels: always consider **all** built-in + extension channels when refactoring shared logic (routing, allowlists, pairing, command gating, onboarding, docs).
  - Core channel docs: `docs/channels/`
  - Core channel code: `src/telegram`, `src/discord`, `src/slack`, `src/signal`, `src/imessage`, `src/web` (WhatsApp web), `src/channels`, `src/routing`
  - Extensions (channel plugins): `extensions/*` (e.g. `extensions/msteams`, `extensions/matrix`, `extensions/zalo`, `extensions/zalouser`, `extensions/voice-call`)
- When adding channels/extensions/apps/docs, update `.github/labeler.yml` and create matching GitHub labels (use existing channel/extension label colors).

## Docs Linking (Mintlify)

- Docs are hosted on Mintlify (docs.foxfang.ai).
- Internal doc links in `docs/**/*.md`: root-relative, no `.md`/`.mdx` (example: `[Config](/configuration)`).
- When working with documentation, read the mintlify skill.
- For docs, UI copy, and picker lists, order services/providers alphabetically unless the section is explicitly describing runtime behavior (for example auto-detection or execution order).
- Section cross-references: use anchors on root-relative paths (example: `[Hooks](/configuration#hooks)`).
- Doc headings and anchors: avoid em dashes and apostrophes in headings because they break Mintlify anchor links.
- When the user asks for links, reply with full `https://docs.foxfang.ai/...` URLs (not root-relative).
- When you touch docs, end the reply with the `https://docs.foxfang.ai/...` URLs you referenced.
- README (GitHub): keep absolute docs URLs (`https://docs.foxfang.ai/...`) so links work on GitHub.
- Docs content must be generic: no personal device names/hostnames/paths; use placeholders like `user@gateway-host` and "gateway host".

## Docs i18n (zh-CN)

- `docs/zh-CN/**` is generated; do not edit unless the user explicitly asks.
- Pipeline: update English docs → adjust glossary (`docs/.i18n/glossary.zh-CN.json`) → run `scripts/docs-i18n` → apply targeted fixes only if instructed.
- Before rerunning `scripts/docs-i18n`, add glossary entries for any new technical terms, page titles, or short nav labels that must stay in English or use a fixed translation (for example `Doctor` or `Polls`).
- `pnpm docs:check-i18n-glossary` enforces glossary coverage for changed English doc titles and short internal doc labels before translation reruns.
- Translation memory: `docs/.i18n/zh-CN.tm.jsonl` (generated).
- See `docs/.i18n/README.md`.
- The pipeline can be slow/inefficient; if it's dragging, ping @jospalmbier on Discord instead of hacking around it.

## exe.dev VM ops (general)

- Access: stable path is `ssh exe.dev` then `ssh vm-name` (assume SSH key already set).
- SSH flaky: use exe.dev web terminal or Shelley (web agent); keep a tmux session for long ops.
- Update: `sudo npm i -g foxfang@latest` (global install needs root on `/usr/lib/node_modules`).
- Config: use `foxfang config set ...`; ensure `gateway.mode=local` is set.
- Discord: store raw token only (no `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=` prefix).
- Restart: stop old gateway and run:
  `pkill -9 -f foxfang-gateway || true; nohup foxfang gateway run --bind loopback --port 18789 --force > /tmp/foxfang-gateway.log 2>&1 &`
- Verify: `foxfang channels status --probe`, `ss -ltnp | rg 18789`, `tail -n 120 /tmp/foxfang-gateway.log`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- Runtime baseline: Node **22+** (keep Node + Bun paths working).
- Install deps: `pnpm install`
- If deps are missing (for example `node_modules` missing, `vitest not found`, or `command not found`), run the repo's package-manager install command (prefer lockfile/README-defined PM), then rerun the exact requested command once. Apply this to test/build/lint/typecheck/dev commands; if retry still fails, report the command and first actionable error.
- Pre-commit hooks: `prek install`. The hook runs the repo verification flow, including `pnpm check`.
- `FAST_COMMIT=1` skips the repo-wide `pnpm format` and `pnpm check` inside the pre-commit hook only. Use it when you intentionally want a faster commit path and are running equivalent targeted verification manually. It does not change CI and does not change what `pnpm check` itself does.
- Also supported: `bun install` (keep `pnpm-lock.yaml` + Bun patching in sync when touching deps/patches).
- Prefer Bun for TypeScript execution (scripts, dev, tests): `bun <file.ts>` / `bunx <tool>`.
- Run CLI in dev: `pnpm foxfang ...` (bun) or `pnpm dev`.
- Node remains supported for running built output (`dist/*`) and production installs.
- Mac packaging (dev): `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` defaults to current arch.
- Type-check/build: `pnpm build`
- TypeScript checks: `pnpm tsgo`
- Lint/format: `pnpm check`
- Format check: `pnpm format` (oxfmt --check)
- Format fix: `pnpm format:fix` (oxfmt --write)
- Terminology:
  - "gate" means a verification command or command set that must be green for the decision you are making.
  - A local dev gate is the fast default loop, usually `pnpm check` plus any scoped test you actually need.
  - A landing gate is the broader bar before pushing `main`, usually `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` when the touched surface can affect build output, packaging, lazy-loading/module boundaries, or published surfaces.
  - A CI gate is whatever the relevant workflow enforces for that lane (for example `check`, `check-additional`, `build-smoke`, or release validation).
- Local dev gate: prefer `pnpm check` for the normal edit loop. It keeps the repo-architecture policy guards out of the default local loop.
- CI architecture gate: `check-additional` enforces architecture and boundary policy guards that are intentionally kept out of the default local loop.
- Formatting gate: the pre-commit hook runs `pnpm format` before `pnpm check`. If you want a formatting-only preflight locally, run `pnpm format` explicitly.
- If you need a fast commit loop, `FAST_COMMIT=1 git commit ...` skips the hook's repo-wide `pnpm format` and `pnpm check`; use that only when you are deliberately covering the touched surface some other way.
- Tests: `pnpm test` (vitest); coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
- Generated baseline artifacts live together under `docs/.generated/`.
- Config schema drift uses `pnpm config:docs:gen` / `pnpm config:docs:check`.
- Plugin SDK API drift uses `pnpm plugin-sdk:api:gen` / `pnpm plugin-sdk:api:check`.
- If you change config schema/help or the public Plugin SDK surface, update the matching baseline artifact and keep the two drift-check flows adjacent in scripts/workflows/docs guidance rather than inventing a third pattern.
- For narrowly scoped changes, prefer narrowly scoped tests that directly validate the touched behavior. If no meaningful scoped test exists, say so explicitly and use the next most direct validation available.
- Verification modes for work on `main`:
  - Default mode: `main` is relatively stable. Count pre-commit hook coverage when it already verified the current tree, avoid rerunning the exact same checks just for ceremony, and prefer keeping CI/main green before landing.
  - Fast-commit mode: `main` is moving fast and you intentionally optimize for shorter commit loops. Prefer explicit local verification close to the final landing point, and it is acceptable to use `--no-verify` for intermediate or catch-up commits after equivalent checks have already run locally.
- Preferred landing bar for pushes to `main`: in Default mode, favor `pnpm check` and `pnpm test` near the final rebase/push point when feasible. In fast-commit mode, verify the touched surface locally near landing without insisting every intermediate commit replay the full hook.
- Scoped tests prove the change itself. `pnpm test` remains the default `main` landing bar; scoped tests do not replace full-suite gates by default.
- Hard gate: if the change can affect build output, packaging, lazy-loading/module boundaries, or published surfaces, `pnpm build` MUST be run and MUST pass before pushing `main`.
- Default rule: do not land changes with failing format, lint, type, build, or required test checks when those failures are caused by the change or plausibly related to the touched surface. Fast-commit mode changes how verification is sequenced; it does not lower the requirement to validate and clean up the touched surface before final landing.
- For narrowly scoped changes, if unrelated failures already exist on latest `origin/main`, state that clearly, report the scoped tests you ran, and ask before broadening scope into unrelated fixes or landing despite those failures.
- Do not use scoped tests as permission to ignore plausibly related failures.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript (ESM). Prefer strict typing; avoid `any`.
- Formatting/linting via Oxlint and Oxfmt.
- Never add `@ts-nocheck` and do not add inline lint suppressions by default. Fix root causes first; only keep a suppression when the code is intentionally correct, the rule cannot express that safely, and the comment explains why.
- Do not disable `no-explicit-any`; prefer real types, `unknown`, or a narrow adapter/helper instead. Update Oxlint/Oxfmt config only when required.
- Dynamic import guardrail: do not mix `await import("x")` and static `import ... from "x"` for the same module in production code paths. If you need lazy loading, create a dedicated `*.runtime.ts` boundary (that re-exports from `x`) and dynamically import that boundary from lazy callers only.
- Dynamic import verification: after refactors that touch lazy-loading/module boundaries, run `pnpm build` and check for `[INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT]` warnings before submitting.
- Extension SDK self-import guardrail: inside an extension package, do not import that same extension via `foxfang/plugin-sdk/<extension>` from production files. Route internal imports through a local barrel such as `./api.ts` or `./runtime-api.ts`, and keep the `plugin-sdk/<extension>` path as the external contract only.
- Extension package boundary guardrail: inside `extensions/<id>/**`, do not use relative imports/exports that resolve outside that same `extensions/<id>` package root. If shared code belongs in the plugin SDK, import `foxfang/plugin-sdk/<subpath>` instead of reaching into `src/plugin-sdk/**` or other repo paths via `../`.
- Extension API surface rule: `foxfang/plugin-sdk/<subpath>` is the only public cross-package contract for extension-facing SDK code. If an extension needs a new seam, add a public subpath first; do not reach into `src/plugin-sdk/**` by relative path.
- Never share class behavior via prototype mutation (`applyPrototypeMixins`, `Object.defineProperty` on `.prototype`, or exporting `Class.prototype` for merges). Use explicit inheritance/composition (`A extends B extends C`) or helper composition so TypeScript can typecheck.
- If this pattern is needed, stop and get explicit approval before shipping; default behavior is to split/refactor into an explicit class hierarchy and keep members strongly typed.
- In tests, prefer per-instance stubs over prototype mutation (`SomeClass.prototype.method = ...`) unless a test explicitly documents why prototype-level patching is required.
- Add brief code comments for tricky or non-obvious logic.
- Keep files concise; extract helpers instead of "V2" copies. Use existing patterns for CLI options and dependency injection via `createDefaultDeps`.
- Aim to keep files under ~700 LOC; guideline only (not a hard guardrail). Split/refactor when it improves clarity or testability.
- Naming: use **FoxFang** for product/app/docs headings; use `foxfang` for CLI command, package/binary, paths, and config keys.
- Written English: use American spelling and grammar in code, comments, docs, and UI strings (e.g. "color" not "colour", "behavior" not "behaviour", "analyze" not "analyse").

## Release / Advisory Workflows

- Use `$foxfang-release-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/foxfang-release-maintainer/SKILL.md` for release naming, version coordination, release auth, and changelog-backed release-note workflows.
- Use `$foxfang-ghsa-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/foxfang-ghsa-maintainer/SKILL.md` for GHSA advisory inspection, patch/publish flow, private-fork checks, and GHSA API validation.
- Release and publish remain explicit-approval actions even when using the skill.

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: Vitest with V8 coverage thresholds (70% lines/branches/functions/statements).
- Naming: match source names with `*.test.ts`; e2e in `*.e2e.test.ts`.
- When tests need example Anthropic/OpenAI model constants, prefer `sonnet-4.6` and `gpt-5.4`; update older Anthropic/GPT examples when you touch those tests.
- Run `pnpm test` (or `pnpm test:coverage`) before pushing when you touch logic.
- Write tests to clean up timers, env, globals, mocks, sockets, temp dirs, and module state so `--isolate=false` stays green.
- Agents MUST NOT modify baseline, inventory, ignore, snapshot, or expected-failure files to silence failing checks without explicit approval in this chat.
- For targeted/local debugging, keep using the wrapper: `pnpm test -- <path-or-filter> [vitest args...]` (for example `pnpm test -- src/commands/onboard-search.test.ts -t "shows registered plugin providers"`); do not default to raw `pnpm vitest run ...` because it bypasses wrapper config/profile/pool routing.
- Do not set test workers above 16; tried already.
- Keep Vitest on `forks` only. Do not introduce or reintroduce any non-`forks` Vitest pool or alternate execution mode in configs, wrapper scripts, or default test commands without explicit approval in this chat. This includes `threads`, `vmThreads`, `vmForks`, and any future/nonstandard pool variant.
- If local Vitest runs cause memory pressure, the wrapper now derives budgets from host capabilities (CPU, memory band, current load). For a conservative explicit override during land/gate runs, use `FOXFANG_TEST_PROFILE=serial FOXFANG_TEST_SERIAL_GATEWAY=1 pnpm test`.
- Live tests (real keys): `FOXFANG_LIVE_TEST=1 pnpm test:live` (FoxFang-only) or `LIVE=1 pnpm test:live` (includes provider live tests). Docker: `pnpm test:docker:live-models`, `pnpm test:docker:live-gateway`. Onboarding Docker E2E: `pnpm test:docker:onboard`.
- `pnpm test:live` defaults quiet now. Keep `[live]` progress; suppress profile/gateway chatter. Full logs: `FOXFANG_LIVE_TEST_QUIET=0 pnpm test:live`.
- Full kit + what's covered: `docs/help/testing.md`.
- Changelog: user-facing changes only; no internal/meta notes (version alignment, appcast reminders, release process).
- Changelog placement: in the active version block, append new entries to the end of the target section (`### Changes` or `### Fixes`); do not insert new entries at the top of a section.
- Changelog attribution: use at most one contributor mention per line; prefer `Thanks @author` and do not also add `by @author` on the same entry.
- Pure test additions/fixes generally do **not** need a changelog entry unless they alter user-facing behavior or the user asks for one.
- Mobile: before using a simulator, check for connected real devices (iOS + Android) and prefer them when available.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Use `$foxfang-pr-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/foxfang-pr-maintainer/SKILL.md` for maintainer PR triage, review, close, search, and landing workflows.
- This includes auto-close labels, bug-fix evidence gates, GitHub comment/search footguns, and maintainer PR decision flow.
- For the repo's end-to-end maintainer PR workflow, use `$foxfang-pr-maintainer` at `.agents/skills/foxfang-pr-maintainer/SKILL.md`.

- `/landpr` lives in the global Codex prompts (`~/.codex/prompts/landpr.md`); when landing or merging any PR, always follow that `/landpr` process.
- Create commits with `scripts/committer "<msg>" <file...>`; avoid manual `git add`/`git commit` so staging stays scoped.
- Follow concise, action-oriented commit messages (e.g. `CLI: add verbose flag to send`).
- Group related changes; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- PR submission template (canonical): `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Issue submission templates (canonical): `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`

## Git Notes

- If `git branch -d/-D <branch>` is policy-blocked, delete the local ref directly: `git update-ref -d refs/heads/<branch>`.
- Agents MUST NOT create or push merge commits on `main`. If `main` has advanced, rebase local commits onto the latest `origin/main` before pushing.
- Bulk PR close/reopen safety: if a close action would affect more than 5 PRs, first ask for explicit user confirmation with the exact PR count and target scope/query.

## Security & Configuration Tips

- Web provider stores creds at `~/.foxfang/credentials/`; rerun `foxfang login` if logged out.
- Pi sessions live under `~/.foxfang/sessions/` by default; the base directory is not configurable.
- Environment variables: see `~/.profile`.
- Never commit or publish real phone numbers, videos, or live configuration values. Use obviously fake placeholders in docs, tests, and examples.
- Release flow: use the private [maintainer release docs](https://github.com/PotLock/maintainers/blob/main/release/README.md) for the actual runbook, `docs/reference/RELEASING.md` for the public release policy, and `$foxfang-release-maintainer` for the maintainership workflow.

## Local Runtime / Platform Notes

- Vocabulary: "makeup" = "mac app".
- Rebrand/migration issues or legacy config/service warnings: run `foxfang doctor` (see `docs/gateway/doctor.md`).
- Use `$foxfang-parallels-smoke` at `.agents/skills/foxfang-parallels-smoke/SKILL.md` for Parallels smoke, rerun, upgrade, debug, and result-interpretation workflows across macOS, Windows, and Linux guests.
- For the macOS Discord roundtrip deep dive, use the narrower `.agents/skills/parallels-discord-roundtrip/SKILL.md` companion skill.
- Never edit `node_modules` (global/Homebrew/npm/git installs too). Updates overwrite. Skill notes go in `tools.md` or `AGENTS.md`.
- If you need local-only `.agents` ignores, use `.git/info/exclude` instead of repo `.gitignore`.
- When adding a new `AGENTS.md` anywhere in the repo, also add a `CLAUDE.md` symlink pointing to it (example: `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`).
- Signal: "update fly" => `fly ssh console -a flawd-bot -C "bash -lc 'cd /data/clawd/foxfang && git pull --rebase origin main'"` then `fly machines restart e825232f34d058 -a flawd-bot`.
- CLI progress: use `src/cli/progress.ts` (`osc-progress` + `@clack/prompts` spinner); don't hand-roll spinners/bars.
- Status output: keep tables + ANSI-safe wrapping (`src/terminal/table.ts`); `status --all` = read-only/pasteable, `status --deep` = probes.
- Gateway currently runs only as the menubar app; there is no separate LaunchAgent/helper label installed. Restart via the FoxFang Mac app or `scripts/restart-mac.sh`; to verify/kill use `launchctl print gui/$UID | grep foxfang` rather than assuming a fixed label. **When debugging on macOS, start/stop the gateway via the app, not ad-hoc tmux sessions; kill any temporary tunnels before handoff.**
- macOS logs: use `./scripts/clawlog.sh` to query unified logs for the FoxFang subsystem; it supports follow/tail/category filters and expects passwordless sudo for `/usr/bin/log`.
- If shared guardrails are available locally, review them; otherwise follow this repo's guidance.
- SwiftUI state management (iOS/macOS): prefer the `Observation` framework (`@Observable`, `@Bindable`) over `ObservableObject`/`@StateObject`; don't introduce new `ObservableObject` unless required for compatibility, and migrate existing usages when touching related code.
- Connection providers: when adding a new connection, update every UI surface and docs (macOS app, web UI, mobile if applicable, onboarding/overview docs) and add matching status + configuration forms so provider lists and settings stay in sync.
- Version locations: `package.json` (CLI), `apps/android/app/build.gradle.kts` (versionName/versionCode), `apps/ios/Sources/Info.plist` + `apps/ios/Tests/Info.plist` (CFBundleShortVersionString/CFBundleVersion), `apps/macos/Sources/FoxFang/Resources/Info.plist` (CFBundleShortVersionString/CFBundleVersion), `docs/install/updating.md` (pinned npm version), and Peekaboo Xcode projects/Info.plists (MARKETING_VERSION/CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION).
- "Bump version everywhere" means all version locations above **except** `appcast.xml` (only touch appcast when cutting a new macOS Sparkle release).
- **Restart apps:** "restart iOS/Android apps" means rebuild (recompile/install) and relaunch, not just kill/launch.
- **Device checks:** before testing, verify connected real devices (iOS/Android) before reaching for simulators/emulators.
- iOS Team ID lookup: `security find-identity -p codesigning -v` → use Apple Development (…) TEAMID. Fallback: `defaults read com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEProvisioningTeamIdentifiers`.
- A2UI bundle hash: `src/canvas-host/a2ui/.bundle.hash` is auto-generated; ignore unexpected changes, and only regenerate via `pnpm canvas:a2ui:bundle` (or `scripts/bundle-a2ui.sh`) when needed. Commit the hash as a separate commit.
- Release signing/notary credentials are managed outside the repo; maintainers keep that setup in the private [maintainer release docs](https://github.com/PotLock/maintainers/tree/main/release).
- Lobster palette: use the shared CLI palette in `src/terminal/palette.ts` (no hardcoded colors); apply palette to onboarding/config prompts and other TTY UI output as needed.
- When asked to open a "session" file, open the Pi session logs under `~/.foxfang/agents/<agentId>/sessions/*.jsonl` (use the `agent=<id>` value in the Runtime line of the system prompt; newest unless a specific ID is given), not the default `sessions.json`. If logs are needed from another machine, SSH via Tailscale and read the same path there.
- Do not rebuild the macOS app over SSH; rebuilds must be run directly on the Mac.
- Voice wake forwarding tips:
  - Command template should stay `foxfang-mac agent --message "${text}" --thinking low`; `VoiceWakeForwarder` already shell-escapes `${text}`. Don't add extra quotes.
  - launchd PATH is minimal; ensure the app's launch agent PATH includes standard system paths plus your pnpm bin (typically `$HOME/Library/pnpm`) so `pnpm`/`foxfang` binaries resolve when invoked via `foxfang-mac`.

## Collaboration / Safety Notes

- When working on a GitHub Issue or PR, print the full URL at the end of the task.
- When answering questions, respond with high-confidence answers only: verify in code; do not guess.
- Never update the Carbon dependency.
- Any dependency with `pnpm.patchedDependencies` must use an exact version (no `^`/`~`).
- Patching dependencies (pnpm patches, overrides, or vendored changes) requires explicit approval; do not do this by default.
- **Multi-agent safety:** do **not** create/apply/drop `git stash` entries unless explicitly requested (this includes `git pull --rebase --autostash`). Assume other agents may be working; keep unrelated WIP untouched and avoid cross-cutting state changes.
- **Multi-agent safety:** when the user says "push", you may `git pull --rebase` to integrate latest changes (never discard other agents' work). When the user says "commit", scope to your changes only. When the user says "commit all", commit everything in grouped chunks.
- **Multi-agent safety:** prefer grouped `commit` / `pull --rebase` / `push` cycles for related work instead of many tiny syncs.
- **Multi-agent safety:** do **not** create/remove/modify `git worktree` checkouts (or edit `.worktrees/*`) unless explicitly requested.
- **Multi-agent safety:** do **not** switch branches / check out a different branch unless explicitly requested.
- **Multi-agent safety:** running multiple agents is OK as long as each agent has its own session.
- **Multi-agent safety:** when you see unrecognized files, keep going; focus on your changes and commit only those.
- Lint/format churn:
  - If staged+unstaged diffs are formatting-only, auto-resolve without asking.
  - If commit/push already requested, auto-stage and include formatting-only follow-ups in the same commit (or a tiny follow-up commit if needed), no extra confirmation.
  - Only ask when changes are semantic (logic/data/behavior).
- **Multi-agent safety:** focus reports on your edits; avoid guard-rail disclaimers unless truly blocked; when multiple agents touch the same file, continue if safe; end with a brief "other files present" note only if relevant.
- Bug investigations: read source code of relevant npm dependencies and all related local code before concluding; aim for high-confidence root cause.
- Code style: add brief comments for tricky logic; keep files under ~500 LOC when feasible (split/refactor as needed).
- Tool schema guardrails (google-antigravity): avoid `Type.Union` in tool input schemas; no `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`. Use `stringEnum`/`optionalStringEnum` (Type.Unsafe enum) for string lists, and `Type.Optional(...)` instead of `... | null`. Keep top-level tool schema as `type: "object"` with `properties`.
- Tool schema guardrails: avoid raw `format` property names in tool schemas; some validators treat `format` as a reserved keyword and reject the schema.
- Never send streaming/partial replies to external messaging surfaces (WhatsApp, Telegram); only final replies should be delivered there. Streaming/tool events may still go to internal UIs/control channel.
- For manual `foxfang message send` messages that include `!`, use the heredoc pattern noted below to avoid the Bash tool's escaping.
- Release guardrails: do not change version numbers without operator's explicit consent; always ask permission before running any npm publish/release step.
- Beta release guardrail: when using a beta Git tag (for example `vYYYY.M.D-beta.N`), publish npm with a matching beta version suffix (for example `YYYY.M.D-beta.N`) rather than a plain version on `--tag beta`; otherwise the plain version name gets consumed/blocked.
