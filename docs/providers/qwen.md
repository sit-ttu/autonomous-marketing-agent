# Qwen

<Warning>

**Qwen OAuth has been removed.** The free-tier OAuth integration
(`qwen-portal`) that used `portal.qwen.ai` endpoints is no longer available.
See [Issue #49557](https://github.com/PotLock/foxfang/issues/49557) for
background.

</Warning>

## Recommended: Model Studio (Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan)

Use [Model Studio](/providers/modelstudio) for officially supported access to
Qwen models (Qwen 3.5 Plus, GLM-4.7, Kimi K2.5, MiniMax M2.5, and more).

```bash
# Global endpoint
foxfang onboard --auth-choice modelstudio-api-key

# China endpoint
foxfang onboard --auth-choice modelstudio-api-key-cn
```

See [Model Studio](/providers/modelstudio) for full setup details.
